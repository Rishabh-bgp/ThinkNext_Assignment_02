Making a technical documentation page using HTML and CSS

In this project, I would design a webpage-like technical documentation using HTML and CSS . Technical documentation is any document that explains the features of the respective product. In this project, I am going to create technical documentation of C++ by using HTML and CSS. The webpage has a menu section that helps to navigate to different sections of the webpage.

Approach:

1. Structure the webpage into two sections: left for a Documentation Menu and right for topic descriptions.
2. Create anchor tags in the left section to serve as navigation links, linking to corresponding IDs on the right (e.g., inheritance, polymorphism).
3. Enable dynamic loading of topic details on the right side when users click on a link in the Documentation Menu.
4. Enhance the web pageâ€™s visual appeal using CSS for text alignment, padding, margin, and overall design aesthetics.
5. Implement responsive design with CSS to adapt the layout for different screen sizes.
